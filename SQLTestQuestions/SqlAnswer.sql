Hello! 

Please use the test data provided in the file 'PersonDatabase' to answer the following
questions. Please also import the dbo.Contacts flat file to a table for use. 

All answers should be executable on a MS SQL Server 2012 instance.

QUESTION 1

The table dbo.Risk contains calculated risk scores for the population in dbo.Person. Write a 
query or group of queries that return the patient name, and their most recent risk level(s). 
Any patients that dont have a risk level should also be included in the results. 

**********************/

WITH info (PersonName, RiskLevel, RiskRank, RiskDateTime) AS (
    SELECT PersonName, RiskLevel, Rank() OVER (PARTITION BY r.PersonID ORDER BY RiskDateTime DESC), RiskDateTime
    FROM Person p
    LEFT JOIN Risk r ON r.PersonID = p.PersonID
)
SELECT PersonName, RiskLevel
FROM info
WHERE RiskRank =1;

/**********************

QUESTION 2


The table dbo.Person contains basic demographic information. The source system users 
input nicknames as strings inside parenthesis. Write a query or group of queries to 
return the full name and nickname of each person. The nickname should contain only letters

	PersonName,
	AttributedPayer AS Payer,
	RiskScore,
	RiskDateTime,
	AVG(RiskScore) OVER (PARTITION BY p.PersonID, AttributedPayer ORDER BY RiskDateTime ASC) AS MovingAverage
