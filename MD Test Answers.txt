Original files were converted to use in MySQL and solutions were written for MySQL. The below solutions have been converted to MS SQL.



QUESTION 1

The table dbo.Risk contains calculated risk scores for the population in dbo.Person. Write a 
query or group of queries that return the patient name, and their most recent risk level(s). 
Any patients that dont have a risk level should also be included in the results. 

**********************/
USE PersonDatabase;
GO
SELECT PersonName, max(r.RiskLevel) AS RiskLevel
FROM dbo.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN dbo.Risk AS r
ON r.PersonID=p.PersonID
GROUP BY PersonName;
GO

/**********************

QUESTION 2


The table dbo.Person contains basic demographic information. The source system users 
input nicknames as strings inside parenthesis. Write a query or group of queries to 
return the full name and nickname of each person. The nickname should contain only letters 
or be blank if no nickname exists.

**********************/
USE PersonDatabase;
GO
SELECT Replace(Replace(PersonName,')',''),'(','') AS Name, SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(PersonName, '(', -1), ')', 1) AS NickName FROM dbo.Person WHERE PersonName LIKE '%(%)%';
GO

/**********************

QUESTION 6

Write a query to return risk data for all patients, all payers 
and a moving average of risk for that patient and payer in dbo.Risk. 

**********************/

USE PersonDatabase;
GO
SELECT p.PersonName, r.RiskDateTime, r.RiskScore, avg(r.RiskScore) OVER(PARTITION BY p.PersonName ORDER BY RiskDateTime ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS MovingAveragePatientRisk, r.AttributedPayer, avg(r.RiskScore) OVER(PARTITION BY r.AttributedPayer, p.PersonID ORDER BY r.AttributedPayer, r.RiskDateTime ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS MovingAveragePayerRisk
FROM dbo.Person AS p
LEFT JOIN dbo.Risk AS r
ON r.PersonID=p.PersonID
ORDER BY p.PersonID, r.RiskDateTime;
GO
