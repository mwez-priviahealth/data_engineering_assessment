Unit Tests for Python Demo

I didn't have time to write the tests, but they would things like the following:

1. Bad XL format - missing columns, wrong names etc.
2. Bad values in data - missing data, wrong datatype etc.
3. Incorrect DB connection
4. Incorrect DB structure (NOT NULL when should be null)
5. Test files and logging showing rows in, rows out and expected results

Each type of error might include a more robust error handler etc.
